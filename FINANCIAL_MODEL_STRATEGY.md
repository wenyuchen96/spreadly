# Financial Model Generation Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines strategies to achieve two key objectives:
1. **Execution Reliability**: Ensure generated code executes successfully in Script Lab
2. **Model Quality**: Generate professional-grade financial models

---

## Strategy 1: Ensuring Script Lab Execution Reliability

### A. API Compatibility Framework ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: Generated code fails due to unsupported Excel.js APIs in web Excel

**Solution**: Strict API compatibility rules in AI prompts
```typescript
✅ ALWAYS USE (100% Compatible):
- sheet.getRange("A1").values = [["value"]]
- range.format.fill.color = "#4472C4"
- range.format.font.bold = true

❌ NEVER USE (Causes failures):
- sheet.getCell() - not available in web Excel
- borders.setItem() - not supported
- Mismatched array dimensions
```

### B. Pre-Execution Validation ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: Code fails during execution due to predictable issues

**Solution**: Client-side validation before execution
```typescript
function validateGeneratedCode(code: string): { isValid: boolean; errors: string[] }
```

**Validates**:
- Unsupported APIs (`getCell`, `borders.setItem`)
- Missing Excel.run wrapper
- Potential dimension mismatches
- Common compatibility issues

### C. Enhanced Error Handling ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: Generic error messages don't help users understand failures

**Solution**: Specific error categorization and guidance
```typescript
if (errorMessage.includes('number of rows or columns')) {
  return `❌ **Array dimension mismatch error**\n\n
  **Solutions:**\n
  • Try asking for the model again (AI will generate different code)\n
  • Use desktop Excel for better API support`
}
```

### D. Fallback Execution Patterns ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Flow**: Script Lab → Direct Execution → Detailed Error Reporting

---

## Strategy 2: High-Quality Financial Model Generation

### A. Enhanced System Prompts ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Financial Modeling Best Practices Integration**:
```python
📊 STRUCTURE & LAYOUT:
- Clear, descriptive headers with proper formatting
- Separate sections: Assumptions, Calculations, Results
- Include units (%, $, years) in headers

🧮 FORMULA EXCELLENCE:
- Use Excel functions: NPV(), IRR(), PMT(), FV(), PV()
- Reference cells for assumptions (don't hardcode values)
- Include sensitivity analysis where applicable

💼 PROFESSIONAL MODELS include:
- {self._get_model_requirements(query)}
```

### B. Model-Specific Requirements ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Dynamic requirements based on model type**:
- **DCF Models**: Free Cash Flow projections, Terminal Value, WACC, sensitivity tables
- **NPV Analysis**: Initial investment, discount rate, IRR, payback period
- **Valuation Models**: Multiple approaches, key multiples, football field charts
- **Budget/Forecast**: Revenue segments, expense breakdown, variance analysis

### C. Professional Formatting Standards ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Consistent Visual Standards**:
- Headers: Bold, colored background (#4472C4)
- Assumptions: Light blue background (#E7F3FF)
- Results: Green background (#D4EDDA)
- Proper number formatting (currency, percentages)

### D. Model Templates & Examples ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Pre-built Templates** (`model_templates.py`):
- Complete DCF model with all components
- NPV analysis with sensitivity tables
- Professional formatting and structure
- Reusable patterns for common calculations

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Reliability (✅ COMPLETED)
- [x] API compatibility rules
- [x] Pre-execution validation
- [x] Enhanced error handling
- [x] Fallback execution patterns

### Phase 2: Quality (✅ COMPLETED)
- [x] Enhanced system prompts
- [x] Model-specific requirements
- [x] Professional formatting standards
- [x] Model templates

### Phase 3: Advanced Improvements (NEXT STEPS)

#### A. Template Integration
```python
# In ai_service_simple.py
if wants_model and use_template:
    from app.services.model_templates import get_template_for_model
    base_template = get_template_for_model(query)
    # Customize template based on specific user requirements
```

#### B. Model Validation
```python
def validate_financial_model(code: str) -> dict:
    """Validate financial logic and best practices"""
    checks = {
        'has_assumptions_section': 'Assumptions' in code,
        'uses_cell_references': '=$' in code,
        'includes_sensitivity': 'sensitivity' in code.lower(),
        'proper_formatting': 'format.fill.color' in code
    }
    return checks
```

#### C. AI Fine-tuning Strategy

**Training Data Requirements**:
1. **Positive Examples**: High-quality financial models that execute successfully
2. **Negative Examples**: Code that fails with specific error types
3. **Best Practices**: Professional formatting and calculation patterns

**Fine-tuning Approach**:
```python
training_examples = [
    {
        "input": "Create an NPV analysis for a 5-year project",
        "output": NPV_TEMPLATE,  # From model_templates.py
        "feedback": "Executes successfully, includes all required components"
    },
    {
        "input": "Build a DCF model",
        "output": DCF_TEMPLATE,
        "feedback": "Professional structure, proper Excel functions"
    }
]
```

#### D. Dynamic Model Customization
```python
def customize_model_template(base_template: str, user_requirements: dict) -> str:
    """Customize template based on specific user needs"""
    # Adjust years of projection
    # Modify discount rates
    # Add specific industry metrics
    # Include user's specific assumptions
```

## Success Metrics

### Execution Reliability
- **Target**: >95% successful execution rate
- **Current**: ~85% (estimated, needs measurement)
- **Key Indicators**: 
  - Reduced API compatibility errors
  - Fewer dimension mismatch failures
  - Better error recovery

### Model Quality
- **Components**: All models include assumptions, calculations, results
- **Formatting**: Consistent professional appearance
- **Functionality**: Proper Excel functions and cell references
- **Business Logic**: Realistic assumptions and comprehensive analysis

---

## Testing & Validation

### Automated Testing
```typescript
const testCases = [
    { query: "NPV analysis", expectsExecution: true },
    { query: "DCF model", expectsExecution: true },
    { query: "budget forecast", expectsExecution: true }
];

testCases.forEach(async (test) => {
    const result = await generateAndExecuteModel(test.query);
    assert(result.success === test.expectsExecution);
});
```

### Manual Quality Review
- Financial accuracy of calculations
- Professional appearance and formatting
- Completeness of analysis components
- User experience and clarity

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Measure Current Performance**: Implement success tracking for both reliability and quality
2. **Template Integration**: Connect model templates to AI generation
3. **Advanced Validation**: Add financial logic validation
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Collect feedback on model quality and usability
5. **Fine-tuning Preparation**: Collect training data for model improvement

This strategy provides a comprehensive framework for achieving both reliable execution and high-quality financial model generation.
